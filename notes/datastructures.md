## Overview

A data structure is a way to store/organize data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

Data structures can be talked about as:

- Mathematical/logical models, or Abstract data types (ADTs)
    - e.g. List is a ADT 
- Implementation
    - Arrays are a concrete implementation


Abstract data types (ADTs) define data and operations, but no implementation details.

Some data structures are:
- Arrays
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Graph

These are some topics that should be explored with data structures:
- Logical view
- Operations
- Cost of operations
- Implementation
