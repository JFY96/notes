# Procedural programming

- Procedural programming involves writing down a list of instructions to tell the computer what it should do step-by-step to finish the task at hand
	- it may be the first programming paradigm that a new developer will learn
	- typically linear top-down approach and it treats data and procedures as two different entities
	- it divides the program into procedures (routines or functions), containing a series of steps to be carried out

Key features
- Predefined functions 
- Local variable
- Global variable
- Modularity
- Parameter passing

Advantages
- Excellent for general purpose programming
- simplicity and ease of implementation of compilers and interpreters
- code can be reused in different parts of the program without the need to copy it
- program flow can be tracked easily

Disadvantages
- Difficult to relate with real-world-objects
- Importance is given to the operation rather than the data, which might pose issues in some data-sensitive cases
- data is exposed to the whole program, so may not be security friendly

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Approach to programming that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

The primary thing to know about OOP is encapsulation, which is the idea that each object which holds the program is self-sustainable, which means that all the components tat make up the object are within the object itself.

Since each module within this paradigm is self-sustainable, objects can be taken from one program and used to resolve another problem at hand with little or no alterations.

Advantages:
- Due to modularity and encapsulation, OOP offers ease of management
- OOP mimics the real world, making it easier to understand
- Since objects are whole within themselves, they are reusable in other programs

Disadvantages:
- Object-Oriented programs tend to be slower and use up a high amount of memory
- Over-generalization
- Programs built using this paradigm may take longer to be created
