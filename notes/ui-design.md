# Simple 60-30-10 Color Rule

- 60% of dominant color
	- usually neutral color e.g. white (#ffffff)
	- likely used as main background color, card colors, text color on secondary color, etc 
- 30% of secondary complementary color
	- support main color and be different enough 
	- likely used as text color on dominant color, highlighted/selected elements
- 10% of accent color 
	- usually bold or subtle to give character
	- used to give elements a distinct look from the rest
	- likely used for action icons, footer/header/tab bars

Tips
- Use greyscale for layout first to save time and apply colors later
